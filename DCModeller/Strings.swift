    static let NetPayDescription = "If you pay under the 'Net Pay' method, your pension contributions are taken from your salary before income tax is deducted. This means you get tax relief at your marginal rate.\n\nMost occupational defined contribution schemes (that is, not Personal Pensions or Group Personal Pensions (GPPs) are set up in this way."
    static let ReliefAtSourceDescription = "If you pay under the 'Relief at Source' method, your pension contributions are taken from your salary after income tax is deducted, and paid across the the pension scheme.\n\nThe pension scheme will then claim tax relief on this at the basic rate, and add this to your pot (even if you are a non-tax payer). If you pay the higher or additional income tax rates, you can claim back additional tax relief through your tax self-assessment form."
    static let SalarySacrificeDescription = "Salary sacrifice is also commonly referred to as 'smart pension contributions' or 'smart pay'. You agree to give up part of your salary in return for the same amount of pension contributions from your employer.\n\nThe benefits of this are that you (and your employer) pay lower national insurance as a result of your reduced salary. In contrast, pension contributions paid through net pay or relief at source remain subject to national insurance."
